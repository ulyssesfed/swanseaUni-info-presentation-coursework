        <h1>swansea University: History and heritage</h1>

        <p>The University's foundation stone was laid by King George V on 19 July 1920 and 89 students (including
        eight female students) enrolled that same year. In 1921, Dr Mary Williams became the first woman to
        be appointed to a Chair at a UK university when she became Professor of French language and
        literature. By September 1939, there were 65 staff and 485 students.</p>

        <p>In 1947 there were just two permanent buildings on campus: Singleton Abbey and the library. The
        Principal, J S Fulton, recognised the need to expand the estate and had a vision of a self-contained
        community, with residential, social and academic facilities on a single site. His vision was to become
        the first university campus in the UK</p>

            The new bay campus gives a 2<sup>nd</sup> site of excellence for Computer Science
and being so close to the sea gives us an endless quantity of H<sub>2</sub>O in
case we get hot.
